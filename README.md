# chip8-emulator
##CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker

## It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s ##

#CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine

#It was made to allow video games to be more easily programmed for these computers

#The simplicity of CHIP-8, and its long history and popularity, has ensured that CHIP-8 emulators and programs are still being made to this day

#There are a number of classic video games ported to CHIP-8, such as Pong, Space Invaders, Tetris, and Pac-Man.

#There are also applications like a random maze generator and Conway's Game of Life#

#There is a CHIP-8 implementation for almost every platform, as well as some development tools. Games are still being developed and cataloged for CHIP-8 today

#in addition to older games resurfacing online in digital archives

#While CHIP-8 and SCHIP have commonly been implemented as emulators, a pure hardware implementation (written in the Verilog language) also exists 

#for certain FPGA boards.
