 CHIP-8 was created by a chad called Joe Weisbecker for the COSMAC VIP microcomputer. It was intended as a much simpler way to make small programs and games for the computer back when computers were suckless. 

Instead of using machine language for the VIPâ€™s CDP1802 processor, you could type in hexadecimal instructions that resembled machine code, but which were more high-level, and interpreted on the fly by a small program (the CHIP-8 emulator/interpreter).

# Installation
- Just compile and run > _i did mine with **TCC**_

### TODO

    A dynamic recompiler using dynarec/jit library
    Support for loading ROMs from the command line
    A cached interpreter
